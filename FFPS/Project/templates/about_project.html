                <p class="text-justify">
                    Every year forest fires destroy a huge area of forest cover, leaving large-scale destruction of flora and fauna in its wake. Forest fires play a major role in driving thousands of species of wildlife to extinction year. Artificial intelligence helps us predict the future and using it in this domain can successfully help us predict forest fires and save wildlife.
                    Any fire essentially depends upon 3 factors which are oxygen, temperature, and humidity.
                    This project aims at predicting the possibility of a forest fire taking place, given the oxygen, humidity, and temperature content of a given place. A concept website that can be created to take inputs from the user and predicts the forest fire probability in real-time, is also shown.

                    <b>Tools and Technology Used:</b><br><br>

                    Technology: HTML, CSS, Python, FLASK (A microweb framework that integrates web applications with any python program).<br><br>
                    Hardware: Device with basic Operating system such as Linux or windows, CPU, GPU and minimum 2GB of storage and memory (RAM).<br><br>
                    Software: This software does not require a particular Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) to run but only a web browser and internet connection because it is a web application.<br><br>

                    <b>Limitation of System:</b><br><br>

                    Data Accuracy and Availability: The effectiveness of a forest fire prevention system heavily relies on the quality and availability of data. Inaccurate or incomplete data, such as outdated weather information or inaccurate fire risk assessments, can impact the system's ability to make accurate predictions and recommendations. Limited data sources or gaps in data coverage can also hinder the system's capabilities.<br><br>
                    Uncertainty in Fire Behavior: Forest fires are dynamic and complex events, and predicting their behavior with absolute certainty is challenging. Fire behavior can be influenced by numerous factors, including topography, vegetation type, wind patterns, and human intervention.<br><br>
